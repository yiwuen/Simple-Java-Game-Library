# Simple Java Game Library (SJGL)

Simple Java Game Library (SJGL) is an open-source game library that uses native Java libraries. This tool serves as a helper library containing and providing helper classes and methods. Its main purpose is to speed up the game development of Java games programmed using built-in libraries. As of right now, SJGL only supports Windows and MacOS. However, in the future, there will be many more platforms that this library will support.
